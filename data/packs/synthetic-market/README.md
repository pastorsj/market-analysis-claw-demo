# synthetic-market pack

A fictional US equity market, made with [NeMo Data Designer](https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/DataDesigner) and
Nemotron, in the same format as the real-data pack [`us-equities`](../us-equities/pack.yaml). It needs no key,
no download and no private data, so it is the public default. Real SEC EDGAR filings and eCFR Title 17 sit
beside it as separate document sources. Every issuer, price and news item in `market_data` is fictional; none
of it is investment advice.

## What is in it

| Source | Kind | Origin | Contents |
|---|---|---|---|
| `market_data` | structured | generated, synthetic | Fictional issuers, their daily prices, declared peers and ticker-linked company news, in DuckDB and Parquet, with leakage-safe prediction views; in the 1-minute profiles, minute bars that `intraday_scan` reads in place |
| `sec_filings` | documents | downloaded, real | SEC EDGAR 8-K and 6-K filings from 2026 Q2 (1,000 pinned filings) |
| `market_regulations` | documents | downloaded, real | eCFR Title 17 as of 2026-08-17 |

The filings are real companies and the issuers are fictional, so the two never mix: no filing is turned into
news, and questions that use both keep them apart.

Profiles (`DATA_PACK_PROFILE`), the scale knob:

| Profile | Issuers | Window | Bars | `daily_prices` | Text |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `ci` | 12 | 2026-06-01 to 2026-08-31 (64 sessions) | 1 minute (300,288) | 768 | committed |
| `interactive` | 50 | from 2025-01-02 (416 sessions) | daily | 20,800 | committed |
| `standard` (default) | 2,000 | from 2024-01-02 (668 sessions) | daily | 1,336,000 | committed |
| `intraday` | 500 | from 2026-03-02 (127 sessions) | 1 minute (24,828,500) | 63,500 | committed |
| `large` | 10,000 | from 2016-01-04 (2,680 sessions) | daily | 26,800,000 | `data generate --profile large` |

`large` needs more text than is committed: `./scripts/demo.sh data generate --profile large` extends `text/` in
place (the first 2,000 issuers stay as they are), and `./scripts/demo.sh up` rebuilds the data image with it.
Measured on a laptop, its build takes about 80 s and peaks at about 11 GB of memory (1.3 million news items,
a 4 GB build and a 1 GB raw dataset).

## Questions

`questions.yaml` holds eleven questions; six are featured and need only the default profiles: market leaders
among the 12 story issuers, news sentiment against the following returns, unusual sessions, the peer network, the
Form 8-K Item 1.05 rule with the one Q2 2026 filing in the sample that reports an incident, and negative company
news beside real filings about operational disruptions (kept apart: the issuers are fictional). The intraday
question needs a 1-minute profile (`ci` or `intraday`). `eval/oracles/` computes the analytics answers from a
build, the slow tests run them on the `ci` build, and `eval/retrieval.yaml` names the documents a retrieval
answer should cite.
Each question declares the `tools` it is expected to use, as the demo scenario picker's pills
([data packs](../../../docs/data-packs.md#sources-capabilities-and-questions)).

### Recorded answers

`recordings/` holds the ten questions of the `standard` profile, recorded on 2026-10-01 with the `.env.example`
models (Nemotron 3 Ultra alone, on build.nvidia.com) and reviewed against `eval/oracles/` and the evidence. Four
were wrong and asked again, twice at most. Three are still wrong, and the bundle keeps them as Ultra answered:

- `news-and-filings` (featured) counts negative news only among the articles `analyze_news_price_relationship`
  could align to a forward return, so it names GIOR, PRAL and KASI with three negative items each; the oracle has
  GIOR and KASI with four. It also finds no Q2 2026 filing about an operational disruption.
- `story-event-context` leaves out the stories published on 2026-08-28, whose two following sessions run past the
  data, without saying so, and cites no evidence.
- `sector-sql` gives each sector's median daily return over the 20 sessions (and says so), not the median of the
  issuers' 20-session returns that the question asks for and the oracle computes.

## How it is made

Two stages, so a build is deterministic and offline while the text still comes from Nemotron:

1. **`demo.sh data generate`** ([`data/generate`](../../generate/README.md)), run rarely. A seeded roster of
   issuer slots (industry, exchange, invented name root, ticker) goes to Data Designer as its seed dataset;
   Nemotron writes each company's name and profile, 12 headline templates per event type and sentiment, and
   the 12 story items. Names and tickers are checked against SEC's ticker lists, and invented roots and
   tickers against a list of unfit words. The result is `text/`, committed and reviewed like code, with
   `checks.json` recording the checks and the cost.
2. **`demo.sh data prepare`** runs `generator/build.py`: seeded numpy streams with the constants in
   `generator/model.yaml` make the prices, volumes and news timing, and write a raw dataset (month-partitioned
   bars, `companies.parquet`, `news.parquet`, a manifest) in the layout a real dataset uses. The market
   importer then builds the tables from it exactly as it does for `us-equities`.

Every random draw comes from `numpy.random.default_rng([seed, crc32(stream), *keys])`, with one stream per
concern and issuer slot. The market is simulated over 2016-01-04 to 2026-08-31 and each profile keeps its
window, so an issuer has the same prices and news in every profile that includes it.

## What is planted

- **Prices**: daily returns are `beta * market + gamma * industry + drift + volatility * noise`, each factor
  Student-t with 4 degrees of freedom. Issuers in one SIC industry share a factor, so declared peers (the most
  liquid issuers with the same SIC code) are correlated. There are no splits or dividends.
- **The 12 story issuers** (slots 0 to 11) trade far more than any other, so they are always the 12 most liquid:
  the `top_12` universe and the prediction population. Each has one story item between 2026-08-17 and
  2026-08-28 (`model.yaml`, `story`) that moves its publication session by 6 to 12 percent, plus 30 percent of
  that over the next five sessions.
- **Background news**: about one item per issuer a month (three for story issuers), with an event type and a
  sentiment label, published between 11:00 and 20:30 UTC on a session day. Each moves the next session's return
  by 0.3 of the issuer's volatility with its sentiment, a modest relationship that
  `analyze_news_price_relationship` finds. Its headline is a seeded template filled with the company's name.
- **Volume** rises with the size of the day's move and is 2 to 4 times higher on news sessions.
- **Minute bars** (`ci`, `intraday`): 391 per session, 09:30 through the 16:00 closing auction, from a Brownian
  bridge between the day's open and close. Their rollup is exactly the daily bar; a test checks it.
- **Prediction**: the anchor is 2026-08-24 21:00 UTC with a five-session horizon; the views expose only what was
  observable then.

Labels: `assets.is_synthetic` is true, news comes from "Synthetic Newswire", the source is marked synthetic in
the UI, and the disclaimer says the data is fictional.

## How it was made

The committed text is for the `standard` profile (2,000 issuers), generated on 2026-09-29 with Data Designer
0.9.3 and `nvidia/nemotron-3-super-120b-a12b` on build.nvidia.com: 2,060 model calls, 566,403 input and
103,191 output tokens, in 27 minutes. A second run the same day renamed 39 issuers in 39 calls: 25 whose
invented root or ticker spelled an unfit word, and 14 whose ticker moved because of them. `text/checks.json`
records the latest run.

| `text/` | the Nemotron text and its checks (`demo.sh data generate`) |
| `corpus/*.manifest.json` | the pinned eCFR snapshot and EDGAR filings (URL and SHA-256 of every file) |
| `eval/` | SQL oracles for the analytics answers, the documents retrieval answers cite, the answer checks (`answers.yaml`) and the GPU guard's cases (`perf.yaml`) of the on-demand checks ([eval](../../../eval/README.md)); never read at runtime |
| `recordings/` | the replay bundle of the ten questions of the `standard` profile (`demo.sh record --all` with the `.env.example` models, [recordings](../../../docs/data-packs.md#recordings)); `intraday-ranges` needs a minute-bar profile |
