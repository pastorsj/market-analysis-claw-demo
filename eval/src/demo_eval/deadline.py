"""The cybersecurity-disclosure check: does an answer state Form 8-K Item 1.05's deadline correctly, or say plainly
that the evidence does not give it?

The retrieved Title 17 text holds Form 8-K (17 CFR 249.308) but not the form's item instructions, so no passage
states the four-business-day deadline. Either answer is right:

- the deadline itself: four business days (after the company determines the incident is material);
- a flag that the evidence does not give the deadline, in any wording: "the deadline is not stated in the retrieved
  text", "I can't cite the filing deadline from these sources", "the deadline is set in the Form 8-K instructions,
  which aren't in this source", "neither is stated here".

Wrong, whatever else the answer says:

- another deadline: "within five business days", "no later than 30 days";
- denying that there is one: "Item 1.05 has no deadline".

The flag must be about the deadline: a negation in a sentence that names the deadline and the evidence. A negation
anywhere else in the answer ("the filing does not include the attacker's identity") is not a flag.
