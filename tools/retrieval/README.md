# retrieval

The `retrieve_evidence` MCP tool. It searches the active data pack's document sources with NVIDIA Nemotron
embed and rerank models (through LangChain's `langchain-nvidia-ai-endpoints`) over Milvus.

One image, three commands:

- `demo-retrieval ingest`: the `retrieval-index` one-shot. It reads `/data/active/corpus/documents.jsonl`,
  splits documents into chunks, embeds the chunks as passages, loads them into a new Milvus collection, points
  the collection alias at it, and writes `/data/active/collection-manifest.json`. It streams the corpus and
  resumes an interrupted build (see [data contract](#data-contract)).
- `demo-retrieval serve` (default): the MCP server. It uses streamable HTTP at `:8120/mcp`, has a `GET /health`
  check, and runs as the `retrieval` service.
- `demo-retrieval benchmark`: the `retrieval-benchmark` one-shot of the analytics-gpu profile. It copies the active
  build's vectors into a GPU Milvus (`MILVUS_GPU_URI`) under `GPU_IVF_FLAT`, times the pack's held-out queries
  (`documents.benchmark_queries`) on both indexes, and writes `/data/active/retrieval-benchmark.json` for the
  Benchmark tab ([retrieval](../../docs/retrieval.md#cpugpu-index-comparison-analytics-gpu)). Answers never use
  the GPU copy. Without `MILVUS_GPU_URI` it does nothing. A build measured once is not measured again, except with
  `--again`, which the GPU guard (`demo.sh test gpu --perf`) uses.

## How it fits

Hermes (in the OpenShell sandbox) calls `mcp__retrieval__retrieve_evidence` at
`http://host.openshell.internal:8120/mcp`. The agent plugin's `pre_tool_call` hook sets `source_ids` to the
job's document sources. The tool accepts only sources that `pack.json` declares with `"kind": "documents"`.
The plugin turns each result into a `retrieval_evidence` receipt for the UI.

Each call runs the same steps:

1. Embed the query once (`input_type=query`).
2. Search every source for the same share of candidates: `min(4 × top_k, 200 ÷ sources)`.
3. Rerank all candidates together in one request. Passages carry text only.

The server sends three OpenInference spans (`embed`, `search`, `rerank`) to Phoenix. They nest under the MCP
SDK's `tools/call retrieve_evidence` span.

## Environment

| Variable | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `RETRIEVER_BASE_URL` | `https://integrate.api.nvidia.com/v1` | build.nvidia.com, a self-hosted NIM, or another OpenAI-compatible endpoint |
| `RETRIEVER_API_KEY` | required | Or the Compose secret file `/run/secrets/retriever_api_key`. Under `demo.sh`, an empty value in `.env` means `INFERENCE_API_KEY` |
| `RETRIEVER_EMBED_MODEL` | `nvidia/nemotron-3-embed-1b` | Changing it rebuilds the index on the next `ingest` |
| `RETRIEVER_RERANK_MODEL` | `nvidia/llama-nemotron-rerank-vl-1b-v2` | |
| `RETRIEVER_RERANK_URL` | unset | Full rerank URL; see below |
| `MILVUS_URI` | `http://milvus:19530` | A local `*.db` path uses Milvus Lite (dev only) |
| `MILVUS_GPU_URI` | unset | `benchmark` only: the GPU Milvus (`http://milvus-gpu:19530` under analytics-gpu) |
| `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_ENDPOINT` | unset | e.g. `http://phoenix:6006/v1/traces`; no spans are exported when unset |

`NVIDIA_BASE_URL` and `NVIDIA_API_KEY` are never read.

Rerank requests go to the first of these that applies:

1. `RETRIEVER_RERANK_URL`, if set.
2. The model's build.nvidia.com endpoint, when the base URL is build.nvidia.com.
3. `{RETRIEVER_BASE_URL}/ranking`, the self-hosted NIM path.

Another endpoint that has no route for the VL reranker needs `RETRIEVER_RERANK_URL` and a rerank model that
endpoint serves.

## Data contract

- **In:** `pack.json` supplies `sources[].id` and `sources[].kind`, and `documents.collection`, the alias name.
  The data build always writes `documents.collection` for a pack with a document corpus.
- **In:** `corpus/documents.jsonl` has one row per document:
  `{document_id, source_id, title, text, url?, published_at?, metadata?}`.
  - `metadata` keys become Milvus dynamic fields and come back in each hit's `metadata`.
  - The key `image` is reserved and rejected, because `NVIDIARerank` would send it to the reranker as an image.
  - Keys that repeat a schema column are rejected too.
- **Out:** `collection-manifest.json`:
  `{collection, physical_collection, source_ids, document_count, chunk_count, embed_model, index}`.

Each build is its own collection, `<alias>__<fingerprint>`. The fingerprint covers the corpus bytes, the embed
URL and model, the chunking and the index parameters.

- Re-running `ingest` on unchanged input does nothing.
- Changed input builds a new collection and moves the alias only when it is complete, so `serve` keeps answering
  from the previous build. Older builds are then dropped.
- The corpus is streamed, never held in memory: one pass validates every row (the schema, unique
  `document_id`s, declared sources) before anything is embedded, and a second chunks, embeds and inserts it in
  batches of 50 chunks.
- An interrupted build resumes. Its collection is still there, under the same fingerprint, so the next run
  looks up each batch's chunk ids (which are stable: `<document_id>:<NNNN>`) and embeds only the missing
  chunks.

## Tool result

`retrieve_evidence(query, source_ids, top_k=8)` returns at most 8 passages (a larger `top_k` returns 8):

- `hits[]`: `rank`, `score` (rerank logit), `vector_score` (cosine), `source_id`, `document_id`, `chunk_id`,
  `title`, `url`, `published_at`, `snippet` and `metadata`.
- `candidate_counts`, per source.
- `collection`, the alias, and `collection_version`, the build it pointed at (`<alias>__<fingerprint>`). The alias
  is resolved once per call, so every source is searched in the same build, even during a reindex.
- `models`: `embed` and `rerank`.
- `index`: HNSW/COSINE, `M=16`, `efConstruction=200`, `ef=128`.
- `timings`: `embed_ms`, `search_ms`, `rerank_ms`, `total_ms`.
- Also `query` and `source_ids`.

### Size

A passage is a chunk of up to 2,400 characters, never cut shorter. Each hit adds about 1 KB of ids, URL,
citation, other metadata and JSON indentation.

The MCP SDK sends every result twice: once as `structuredContent` and once as the same JSON in a text block.
The response on the wire is therefore about double one copy. Hermes drops `structuredContent` when a text block
repeats it, so the model reads only one copy, as a JSON string, with the receipts plugin's `evidence_id`.

Hermes saves a result longer than 50,000 characters to a file the agent cannot read
([tool result size](../../docs/architecture.md#tool-result-size)). So `budget.py` caps a call at 8 passages and
drops the lowest-ranked ones while the result is longer than 30,000 characters as the agent reads it; a lone
passage that is still too long has its title, metadata and text cut. `tests/test_budget.py` measures the worst
case: eight full chunks of text that JSON escapes twice, with long titles, URLs and metadata.

| `top_k` | as the agent reads it | JSON-RPC response |
|---|---|---|
| 3 | 11 KB | 21 KB |
| 8 (default and most) | 27 KB, 30 KB at most | 53 KB |

OpenShell 0.1.2 limits JSON-RPC bodies to 64 KiB by default, but only request bodies (the tool arguments), so
these responses pass through.

## LangChain configuration choices

Everything uses public API; there are no patches.

1. **`register_model` for `nemotron-3-embed-1b`.** Release 1.4.3 has no table entry for the model. Without
   one, construction runs a blocking `GET /v1/models` lookup.
2. **Explicit `base_url` and `api_key` on every client.** The package's defaults come from `NVIDIA_BASE_URL` and
   `NVIDIA_API_KEY`, which belong to other services in this stack.
3. **Rerank `max_batch_size=200`.** Search never collects more than 200 candidates, so reranking is always one
   request. A 200-passage request was verified live.
4. **Retries around every embed and rerank call.** The clients have none, and their timeout is fixed at 60 s.
   - These are retried: dropped connections, timeouts, 408, 429 and 5xx. That includes the async client's
     `[###] Unknown Error`, which is how it reports a non-JSON error body, such as a gateway's 502/503/504 page.
   - A tool call gets 3 attempts, because an agent is waiting on it.
   - `ingest` gets 8 attempts, with 0.5 s to 8 s of jittered backoff. A request that fails for good stops the
     build; the next run resumes it.
5. **Three explicit spans.** LangChain's instrumentation emits nothing for direct embed, search or rerank calls.
6. **Pin `==1.4.3` and set `NVIDIA_USAGE_TELEMETRY_ENABLED=false`.** The next release turns on usage telemetry
   by default, and 1.4.3 is the floor for GHSA-g28h-2cmm-rj9x.
7. **The metadata key `image` is reserved.**

The store is plain `pymilvus` 2.6, matching the Milvus 2.6 server, with an explicit schema:

- `chunk_id` primary key and `source_id` partition key;
- `document_id`, `title`, `url`, `published_at` and `text` columns;
- an `embedding` `FLOAT_VECTOR` column;
- dynamic fields for each source's extra metadata.

`milvus/embedEtcd.yaml` and `milvus/user.yaml` configure the single-container Milvus: embedded etcd, local
storage, no MinIO. They come from the official `standalone_embed.sh` recipe. `milvus-gpu` uses the same recipe on
the GPU image, with `milvus/gpu.yaml` as its `user.yaml`: a GPU memory pool of 1 GiB at start, 4 GiB at most.

## Run

`scripts/demo.sh` runs both as part of the stack. By hand, from the repository root:

```bash
./scripts/demo.sh data reindex   # build or refresh the index
./scripts/demo.sh up             # serve at 127.0.0.1:8120/mcp, with the rest of the stack
```

Raw Compose needs the OpenShell pins, `.env` and the `core` profile, which `retrieval-index` depends on:
`docker compose --env-file infra/openshell/versions.env --env-file .env --profile core --profile retrieval
run --rm retrieval-index`.

The image runs as uid 1000. `ingest` writes the manifest into `/data/active`, so `retrieval-index` mounts the
`demo-data` volume read-write, as `retrieval-benchmark` does for its result; `retrieval` mounts it read-only.

Locally, with Milvus Lite:

```bash
cd tools/retrieval && uv sync
MILVUS_URI=./milvus.db RETRIEVER_API_KEY=nvapi-... uv run demo-retrieval ingest --data-dir ../../path/to/active
```

## Test

```bash
uv run pytest                                  # offline: Milvus Lite + a fake NVIDIA transport
RETRIEVER_API_KEY=nvapi-... uv run pytest -m live   # 20 documents against build.nvidia.com; never in CI
```
