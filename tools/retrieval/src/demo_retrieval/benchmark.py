"""retrieval-benchmark: the CPU index against an NVIDIA GPU (cuVS) index of the same vectors (analytics-gpu profile).

The one-shot reads the active build's vectors from Milvus and mirrors them, L2-normalized, into the GPU Milvus
(MILVUS_GPU_URI) under a GPU_IVF_FLAT index. It embeds the pack's held-out queries (documents.benchmark_queries) once
per build and keeps their vectors beside the manifest (retrieval-benchmark-queries.npz), so every measurement of a
build searches the same vectors: the hosted model's vector for one text differs in the last bits from call to call. It
times their vector searches on both indexes in three workload profiles: one query per request, batches of five query
vectors, and five concurrent requests. Each profile warms both indexes up, then repeats its requests three times,
alternating which index goes first. Only the Milvus search call is timed; nothing is reranked.

Each profile reports recall@10 against the exact inner-product neighbors (computed here from the same vectors) and the
overlap of the two indexes' results. Both compare neighbors by their exact score, from one product of the query with
every vector, so a chunk scores the same number as a true neighbor and as a result. Scores within TIE_TOLERANCE are one
neighbor, so chunks with identical vectors (boilerplate repeated across filings) count as the same neighbor whichever of
them an index returns. A profile claims a GPU speedup only when those quality gates pass and the CPU's total search
time is at least 1.1 times the GPU's.

The one-shot (`demo.sh up`, `data reindex`) writes retrieval-benchmark.json beside collection-manifest.json, where the
API reads it for runs on the same build (demo_api.benchmark.RetrievalBenchmark). On an unchanged build whose GPU copy
has the current index it is a no-op; a new GPU index rebuilds the copy and measures again. `benchmark --guard` (the GPU
guard, `demo.sh test gpu --perf`) measures the build once more into retrieval-benchmark-guard.json, and never changes
what the API serves. The one-shot never fails the stack: a problem is logged, and the Benchmark tab says no comparison
applies.

Answers never come from the GPU mirror: retrieve_evidence searches the CPU index on every host.
