"""The market tools and the dispatcher the worker process runs them through.

Two tools need data a pack may not have: the news tools a ticker-linked news table, and intraday_scan minute bars.
They stay registered everywhere, so the tool registry, the sandbox policy and the UI never change with the pack;
on a pack without that data they fail at once with `news_unavailable` or `minute_bars_unavailable`.
