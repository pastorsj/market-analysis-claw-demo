"""Process entry points: the server (`market-analytics-server`) and the analytics worker it spawns.

RAPIDS' zero-code-change accelerators only take effect if they are installed before pandas, scikit-learn or
NetworkX is imported. So this module imports only the standard library, and the worker installs them before
anything else. A spawned process re-imports this entry module and unpickles `worker_main` by reference, so
neither step imports pandas early. Only the worker uses the GPU; the server process stays on the CPU.
