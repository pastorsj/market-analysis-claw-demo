# Operations

Running the demo day to day: the lifecycle commands, Phoenix, jobs and recordings, troubleshooting, and
running it on a Brev VM. Run `./scripts/demo.sh` with no arguments for the command list.

## Lifecycle

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `./scripts/demo.sh up [--no-build]` | Builds the images, prepares the data, starts the tools, Switchyard, Phoenix and the API, then the sandbox, the Hermes forwarder and the UI. Idempotent: a repeat `up` recreates only what changed and keeps the sandbox |
| `./scripts/demo.sh status` | Services, the sandbox and its endpoints, Switchyard's routes and the URLs |
| `./scripts/demo.sh check` | Proves the sandbox boundary on the running stack ([OpenShell](openshell.md#proving-the-boundary)) |
| `./scripts/demo.sh logs [agent\|routing\|SERVICE...] [-f]` | `agent`: Hermes in the sandbox; `routing`: Switchyard's per-call log; otherwise `docker compose logs` |
| `./scripts/demo.sh restart switchyard` | Re-renders the routes from `.env`, clears latches and stats, refreshes the API's model ids |
| `./scripts/demo.sh restart agent` | Recreates the sandbox |
| `./scripts/demo.sh restart SERVICE` | `docker compose restart SERVICE` |
| `./scripts/demo.sh down [--volumes] [--prune]` | Deletes the sandbox, then stops everything; `--volumes` also deletes the data, the index, the jobs and the traces; `--prune` also removes this project's untagged images and Docker's unused build cache, which is host-wide ([disk](#disk)) |

The first `up` builds every image (Switchyard compiles from source), downloads about 1.4 GB of SEC EDGAR
filings and embeds about 23,600 chunks through the retriever endpoint; `up` waits up to an hour for it. Later
runs reuse the images, the download cache and the index.

## Phoenix

Phoenix runs at <http://127.0.0.1:6006>, on loopback only. All traces go to the project
`market-analysis-agent`:

| Source | Spans |
|---|---|
| Hermes, through NeMo Relay | The agent turn, each model call and each tool call. Run metadata (`aiq.job.ref`, `hermes.*`) is promoted to span attributes |
| Switchyard | `libsy.run` per request, with `switchyard.route`, `session.id` (the job id) and `evidence.verdict` (`continue`, `pending`, `escalate` or `latched` on escalation templates) |
| Retrieval | `embed`, `search` and `rerank`, under the MCP `tools/call retrieve_evidence` span |

In the UI, each run's execution view links to its trace. The API finds it through
`GET /v1/jobs/async/job/{id}/trace`, which looks the job up by `aiq.job.ref` and falls back to `session.id`;
the link is `<PHOENIX_URL>/redirects/traces/<trace id>`. Set `PHOENIX_URL` in `.env` if the browser reaches
Phoenix at another address, or to empty to hide the link.

**What traces hold.** Relay exports without an allowlist or a collector. Model spans carry the system
instructions and the current turn from the last user message on, including every tool result; only earlier
conversation turns are dropped (`enable_full_payloads = false` in `agent/profile/relay-plugins.toml`). That is
why Phoenix must stay on loopback. Traces persist in the `phoenix-data` volume until `down --volumes`.

The export is bounded (a queue of 512 spans, batches of 32 every second), so a full queue drops new spans
instead of growing. The agent image fails to build with NeMo Relay 0.9 or later, which cannot export plain
HTTP to Phoenix from the sandbox.

**Routing without Phoenix.**

```bash
./scripts/demo.sh logs routing -f                                          # one line per upstream call
curl -s "127.0.0.1:4000/v1/routing/session-stats?session_id=<job id>"      # calls and tokens per model
curl -s 127.0.0.1:4000/v1/stats                                            # totals, errors, routing overhead
```

## Jobs

- One job runs at a time and four more may wait; a sixth gets `429` with `Retry-After`.
- A job has a 1,200 s deadline and Hermes run budgets (idle, no progress, tool calls); on any of them it fails
  with a message the UI shows, and its Hermes run is stopped.
- Cancelling a queued job means it never starts; cancelling a running one stops its Hermes run.
- When the API restarts, it fails every unfinished job ("The API restarted before this job finished; please
  retry.") and stops its Hermes run.
- Finished jobs stay for `JOB_RETENTION_SECONDS` (a day by default).

The API's settings are in [`api/README.md`](../api/README.md#environment).

## Recording and replay

```bash
./scripts/demo.sh record           # ask the featured questions on the running stack; writes the pack's bundle
./scripts/demo.sh replay           # the UI alone on the bundle: no .env, keys, API or GPU
./scripts/demo.sh up               # back to live mode (recreates only the UI)
```

`replay` swaps the UI container into replay mode on the same port. [Data packs](data-packs.md#recordings)
covers the options and what to review before committing a bundle.

## Disk

Measured with `df` on a Brev A100 VM with every profile (`core,retrieval,analytics-gpu,kumo,ontology`),
starting from an empty Docker host:

| After | Disk used |
|---|---|
| The OS and Brev's tools | 9 GB |
| Building the images: 24 GB of images (15 GB of it the RAPIDS market-analytics image) and 53 GB of build cache, as `docker system df` counts them | 76 GB |
| Pulling the Kumo NIM (about 14 GB to download, 44 GB unpacked), Phoenix, Milvus, pgvector and OpenShell | 115 GB |
| Preparing the data, the corpus and the index | 117 GB |
| One rebuild of the RAPIDS image after a one-line code change | 132 GB |
| Capping the build cache at 30 GB, then an `up` that rebuilt most images | 98 GB, peak 130 GB |
| The GPU parity test's venv ([Brev VM mode](#brev-vm-mode), step 9) | +9 GB |
| Another RAPIDS rebuild, with no prune in between | peak 161 GB, 153 GB after |

So the first `up` takes about 110 GB. Plan for 150 GB free to run the demo, and for 200 GB, or a prune after
each rebuild, if you change code and rebuild images on the host. The CPU tier builds no RAPIDS image and pulls
no Kumo NIM. `docker system df` shows the current split.

What grows is the build cache. Each rebuild of a changed image adds its new layers, and the RAPIDS image adds
about 15 GB each time, even for a one-line change. With Docker's classic image store, each rebuild also
leaves the previous image untagged. `./scripts/demo.sh down --prune` removes both: this project's untagged
images, and Docker's unused build cache. The build cache is host-wide, not per project, so `--prune` also
clears other projects' unused cache (never their images, containers or volumes), and the next build starts
cold (about 15 minutes with every profile). To trim the cache instead while the stack runs, cap it:

```bash
docker builder prune --force --max-used-space 30gb   # keeps at most 30 GB, the most recently used
```

Either way, the next `up` pays for it. Built images keep their IDs only while their layers are cached, so
after a prune or a cap `up` rebuilds most images and recreates their containers. On the A100 VM, that took
10 minutes after capping the cache at 30 GB; the agent image kept its ID, so the sandbox stayed.

`down --volumes` deletes the data, the index, the jobs and the traces; `up` rebuilds them (about 25 minutes,
most of it embedding the corpus).

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause and fix |
|---|---|
| `error: no .env yet` | Run `./scripts/demo.sh init`, then add the keys |
| `doctor` reports a problem | Each message names the variable or host requirement; fix it and run `doctor --keys` again |
| `SEC_USER_AGENT is empty` | Set it to a name and an email, or use `DATA_CORPORA=market_regulations,market_briefs` (skips the SEC download and keeps the fictional briefs) |
| Milvus restarts or is unhealthy | Docker has less than 8 GiB of memory. Give it more, or drop the retrieval profile |
| `sandbox hermes is not Ready after 180s` | The sandbox's recent log is printed just before it. Check the Docker host kernel (Linux 6.2+ with Landlock) and `docker compose logs openshell-preflight openshell` |
| `hermes-gateway` never turns healthy | The sandbox is not Ready, or `HERMES_API_SERVER_KEY` is shorter than 16 characters (run `init`) |
| A tool call fails while the sandbox is Ready | `./scripts/demo.sh check`, then `./scripts/demo.sh logs agent`: `DENIED` lines name the binary, host and reason |
| Model calls fail with 403 | The key's access group does not include a configured model. `doctor --keys` checks only that the endpoint lists it. See `./scripts/demo.sh logs switchyard` |
| `429` when asking a question | The queue is full (one running, four waiting); wait or cancel a job |
| A job fails: "the evidence for its tool calls was not recorded" | The API rejected a receipt that breaks the display-safe limits, or the plugin could not post it. See `./scripts/demo.sh logs api` and `./scripts/demo.sh logs agent` |
| A job fails: "The API restarted before this job finished" | The API restarted during the job; ask again |
| A job fails after about 10 minutes: "Hermes stopped after exceeding its idle budget; please retry." | A model call stalled upstream and never returned, so Hermes waited out `HERMES_RUN_IDLE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` (600 s). Ask again. It happened once in 17 jobs on the A100 VM |
| A run has no Phoenix link | Phoenix has no span for the job yet (Relay exports every second), or `PHOENIX_URL` is empty |
| Market tools answer from old data | `./scripts/demo.sh data prepare` restarts market analytics on the new build; after a manual data change, `./scripts/demo.sh restart market-analytics` |
| Every `up` recreates containers or the sandbox | An image got a new ID. Build through `demo.sh`, which turns off provenance attestations; a plain `docker build` retags the image with a different ID |
| `the ontology profile needs the private submodule` | Run `git submodule update --init --checkout vendor/auto-ontology` (needs access), or drop the profile |

For the sandbox specifically, see the troubleshooting table in
[`infra/openshell/README.md`](../infra/openshell/README.md#troubleshooting).

## Brev VM mode

The GPU tier (`analytics-gpu`, the local Kumo NIM) runs on a Linux x86_64 VM with an NVIDIA GPU, such as a
Brev A100 instance. Nothing about the demo changes: the same `demo.sh`, bound to the VM's loopback, reached
over SSH, or with the UI alone shared through a Brev secure link (step 8). These steps were run on 2026-09-29
on a fresh Brev A100 (40 GB) VM with 12 vCPUs, 83 GiB of memory and a 533 GB disk (Ubuntu 22.04, kernel 6.8,
Docker 29.8 with Compose 5.5, driver 595, NVIDIA Container Toolkit 1.20, as Brev provisions it), with every
profile and the default corpora. `up` needed nothing else installed.

1. **Check the host.** Docker Engine 28+ with Compose 2.30+, a kernel of 6.2 or later (for Landlock), and the
   NVIDIA Container Toolkit (`docker info` lists the `nvidia` runtime). Plan for 150 GB of free disk with
   every profile ([disk](#disk)).
2. **Get the code** on the VM. With GitHub access there, `git clone` it; for the ontology profile, also run
   `git submodule update --init --checkout vendor/auto-ontology`, which needs access to the private
   repository. The VM needs no GitHub credentials if you ship git bundles from your machine instead. Bundle
   the submodule from a checkout of it, because `git -C vendor/auto-ontology` in an empty submodule directory
   would bundle the demo repository:

   ```bash
   # On your machine, in your clone, with vendor/auto-ontology checked out
   git bundle create /tmp/demo.bundle --all
   git -C vendor/auto-ontology bundle create /tmp/auto-ontology.bundle --all   # ontology profile only
   scp /tmp/demo.bundle /tmp/auto-ontology.bundle <instance>:/tmp/

   # On the VM
   git clone /tmp/demo.bundle market-analysis-claw-demo && cd market-analysis-claw-demo
   git submodule init vendor/auto-ontology
   git config submodule.vendor/auto-ontology.url /tmp/auto-ontology.bundle
   git -c protocol.file.allow=always submodule update --checkout vendor/auto-ontology
   ```

   Git refuses a local submodule URL without `protocol.file.allow`. To update later, bundle and copy again,
   then run `git pull` on the VM: the clone's `origin` is the bundle's path. If the pull moved the submodule's
   pin, copy a fresh submodule bundle too and run the `submodule update` line again.
3. **Configure.** Run `./scripts/demo.sh init` on the VM, then edit `.env` there (it stays mode 600). Keep keys
   off command lines, where the shell history and the process list would see them. Set `INFERENCE_API_KEY`
   (your `nvapi-` key, which also serves the retriever) and `SEC_USER_AGENT`, then the profiles (leave out
   `ontology` without the submodule):

   ```bash
   COMPOSE_PROFILES=core,retrieval,analytics-gpu,kumo,ontology
   ```

   Remove any hosted `KUMO_RELATIONAL_URL`, since the kumo profile runs its own NIM.
4. **The Kumo NIM image.** `up` pulls `nvcr.io/nim/nvidia/kumo-relational:1.0.1`, and the pull worked
   without a login (on 2026-09-29: about 14 GB to download in 5 minutes, 44 GB unpacked). If the pull is
   denied, log in with an NGC API key, piped rather than typed on the command line:

   ```bash
   printf '%s' "$NGC_API_KEY" | docker login nvcr.io --username '$oauthtoken' --password-stdin
   ```

   The NIM has no GPU gate and needs no override on a GPU outside its support matrix, such as the A100. Its
   only model profile (PyTorch, fp32) carries no GPU tag, so the NIM selects it on any GPU by hardware
   filtering. It logs `TagsBasedProfileSelector not able to find the profile` and then
   `ManifestProfileSelector compatible profile selected`, which is expected. `NIM_MODEL_PROFILE` would pin a
   profile, but there is only one.
5. **Start and prove it.**

   ```bash
   ./scripts/demo.sh doctor --keys
   ./scripts/demo.sh up
   ./scripts/demo.sh check
   ```

   The first `up` with every profile took about 43 minutes on the A100 VM:

   | Step | Time |
   |---|---|
   | Building the images (Switchyard compiles from source; the RAPIDS image is 15 GB) | 14 min |
   | Pulling the Kumo NIM, Milvus, Phoenix and pgvector | 5 min |
   | The data pack (qualification profile, 2,000 issuers) | 1.5 min |
   | Downloading the corpus (SEC EDGAR, eCFR and the briefs: 5,229 documents) | 5.5 min |
   | Embedding and indexing 23,654 chunks through the retriever endpoint | 15 min |
   | The OpenShell gateway, the sandbox, the Hermes forwarder and the UI | 40 s |

   A later `up` that rebuilt only the RAPIDS image took 11 minutes, 9 of them rebuilding it. With nothing
   changed, a repeat `up` took 36 s and recreated only what differed (after `replay`, just the UI), keeping the
   sandbox. `down` took 46 s and the `up` after it 85 s, which recreates the sandbox and reuses the data and
   the index. Updating the code from a new bundle (step 2) and running `up` took 31 s and recreated nothing
   when only documentation changed; a change under `tools/market-analytics` rebuilds the RAPIDS image
   (9 to 11 minutes).

   Once the stack was up, `check` passed 8 of 8, and the hero questions in
   [models and routing](models-and-routing.md) (H1 to H7) each finished in 21 s to 3 minutes with citations
   and a Phoenix trace.
6. **Footprint, and one GPU for both.** Sampled every 10 s with `df`, `free` and `nvidia-smi` through the
   install and the tests:

   | Resource | Whole stack, idle | Peak, and when |
   |---|---|---|
   | Disk | 108 GB above the OS after the first `up` | 152 GB above the OS, after two RAPIDS rebuilds without a prune and the parity test's venv ([disk](#disk)) |
   | Memory | 9.3 GiB used, 6.7 GiB of it the containers (the Kumo NIM 1.8 GiB, the RAPIDS worker 1.9 GiB) | 14.0 GiB, while `up` built the images |
   | GPU memory | 2.2 GiB before the first prediction, 4.3 GiB after | 5.6 GiB, with the benchmark's extra RAPIDS worker (step 7) running beside the stack |

   `kumo-relational` and `market-analytics-gpu` both request `gpus: all` and share the GPU, and neither
   preallocates a memory pool. At idle the Kumo NIM held 0.85 GiB and the RAPIDS worker 0.5 GiB. After its
   first predictions the NIM kept about 3 GiB (PyTorch's cache). A single 40 GB GPU runs both with room to
   spare; smaller GPUs were not tried.

   **Kumo on the VM.** The NIM turned healthy about 40 s after it started. A prediction through
   `predict_asset_outcomes` took 10.5 to 12.6 s for the two return templates and 0.6 s for `news_event`.
   Each returned one probability per asset in the population (12 on the qualification pack) for the requested
   anchor and horizon, and repeat calls returned identical probabilities. The pack's events are fictional and
   planted, and the history before the anchor does not foretell them: present the probabilities as the
   model's output, not as a forecast.
7. **What the GPU buys here.** The RAPIDS worker gives the same answers as pandas (the parity test below, and
   every tool on the real pack). The method: a throwaway container from the stack's own `market-analytics:gpu`
   image, with `--gpus all` and the prepared pack mounted read-only, ran the service's worker with
   `MARKET_ANALYTICS_ENGINE=cpu` and then with `gpu`, never both at once, while the stack sat idle. Each call
   ran once to warm up, then five timed repeats; the time is the tool's own compute timer, the one receipts and
   the explorer show. All nine calls returned the same results on both engines. Median compute per call on the
   A100 (12 vCPUs), before and after the worker moved to tz-naive UTC timestamps
   ([why](../tools/market-analytics/README.md#how-it-fits)):

   | Call | CPU | GPU before | GPU after | CPU/GPU after |
   |---|---|---|---|---|
   | `market_scan`, 2,000 issuers, 2024 to 2026 | 229 ms | 1,560 ms | 77 ms | 3.0x |
   | `market_scan`, 2,000 issuers, volume z-score | 228 ms | 1,556 ms | 82 ms | 2.8x |
   | `market_scan`, 12 reviewed assets, 20 sessions | 86 ms | 686 ms | 56 ms | 1.5x |
   | `market_anomaly_scan`, 12 assets | 76 ms | 502 ms | 41 ms | 1.8x |
   | `market_anomaly_scan`, 2,000 issuers | 291 ms | 1,512 ms | 119 ms | 2.5x |
   | `price_context`, 3 assets | 70 ms | 672 ms | 33 ms | 2.1x |
   | `sentiment_timeline` | 29 ms | 200 ms | 40 ms | 0.7x |
   | `analyze_news_price_relationship` | 746 ms | 2,171 ms | 92 ms | 8.1x |
   | `analyze_market_relationships` | 37 ms | 39 ms | 37 ms | 1.0x |

   The CPU column is the current code; the CPU results are byte-for-byte those of the code before the change.
   Before it, every operation on a frame with a tz-aware timestamp fell back to pandas and paid a failed GPU
   attempt on top. Now no tool call falls back (the GPU tests check it). Only starting the worker does: once
   each for `merge_asof` and `rename_axis` while it loads the pack (cudf.pandas lacks them), and twice while the
   warm-up reads its window. So `CUDF_PANDAS_FAIL_ON_FALLBACK=1` still stops the worker while it loads.
   `sentiment_timeline` stays slower on the GPU and `analyze_market_relationships` breaks even: their work is
   small (22,000 news rows into 11 weekly points; PageRank over 2,000 nodes), so the fixed cost of
   launching GPU kernels and copying results back outweighs the arithmetic. The table and the method are also in the
   [market-analytics README](../tools/market-analytics/README.md#cpu-and-gpu-timings).

   The GPU libraries pay a one-time cost on first use: about 11 s, nearly all of it cudf.pandas compiling
   kernels for the first `market_scan`. (cuml.accel's first PCA added 5 s more, and again for some input
   sizes; that was its input check compiling a kernel, and the anomaly tool now checks its input on the host
   instead.) The worker runs every tool once before it reports ready, so the first question does not pay it:
   after the warm-up, the first call of each shape above, and of 26 other argument shapes, took at most
   270 ms (the 2,000-issuer anomaly scan, usually about 145 ms; the others about 100 ms or less). Starting
   the worker takes 25 s on the GPU and 10 s on the CPU, warm-up included (the worker's `ready` log line gives
   the warm-up's share). The worker runs one call at a time, so when the agent asks for two tools at once, the second waits
   for the first. The explorer shows each call's device, library and time.
8. **Connect** from your machine with an SSH tunnel; every port stays on the VM's loopback:

   ```bash
   ssh -N -L 3100:127.0.0.1:3100 -L 6006:127.0.0.1:6006 <instance>
   ```

   Then open <http://127.0.0.1:3100> (UI) and <http://127.0.0.1:6006> (Phoenix). With Brev's CLI set up, the
   instance name works as the SSH host.

   **Or share the UI through a Brev secure link**, for people without SSH access. The link's proxy does not
   reach the VM's loopback: it connects over Brev's private network interface (`wt0`) to the link's port,
   so with the default binding the link answers 503 (`Connection refused` on the error page). Publish the UI,
   and only the UI, beyond loopback:

   ```bash
   # In .env on the VM
   UI_BIND_HOST=0.0.0.0
   ```

   Then run `./scripts/demo.sh up --no-build`; of the running services, only `ui` changes, so only it is
   recreated. To recreate it alone by hand, `docker compose --env-file infra/openshell/versions.env --env-file .env up -d
   --no-deps ui` (`--no-deps` keeps Compose from recreating the API without the values `demo.sh` derives).

   The link must point at the UI's host port, `UI_PORT` (3100 by default). If the instance has no link yet,
   create one in the Brev console on the instance's page (**Access**, then share or expose port 3100). The UI
   serves the page and proxies `/api/v1` to the API over the Compose network, so the link needs no other
   port. The API, the tools, Switchyard and Phoenix stay on the VM's loopback whatever `UI_BIND_HOST` says,
   and `doctor` and `up` warn while it is not `127.0.0.1`.

   Security: the UI has no sign-in, and through it anyone who can open the link can run the agent and spend
   your inference credits. Whether the link asks for a Brev sign-in is set in the Brev console, not here;
   use `0.0.0.0` only for a proxy you trust, and set it back to `127.0.0.1` when you are done (then
   `up --no-build` again). Phoenix stays tunnel-only: the UI's **Open in Phoenix** link points at
   <http://127.0.0.1:6006> on the viewer's own machine, so it works only for someone running the SSH tunnel
   above.
9. **Tests on the VM** (optional) need uv, which Brev's image has (in `~/.local/bin`, on a login shell's
   `PATH`), and Node.js 22, which it lacks. `test e2e` installs Chromium's system libraries with apt through
   sudo.

   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_22.x | sudo -E bash - && sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
   ./scripts/demo.sh test e2e
   ```

   The CPU/GPU parity test runs on the VM itself with Brev's uv, which fetches Python 3.12 and the RAPIDS
   wheels (about 5 GB to download, 8.5 GB in `tools/market-analytics/.venv`; the sync took 1 minute, the tests
   30 s):

   ```bash
   cd tools/market-analytics && uv sync --extra gpu-cu12 && uv run pytest -m gpu
   ```

**Troubleshooting on the VM.** What came up on the A100 VM, besides the [general table](#troubleshooting):

| Symptom | Cause and fix |
|---|---|
| `fatal: transport 'file' not allowed` from `submodule update` | Git refuses a local submodule URL by default; use the `-c protocol.file.allow=always` line in step 2 |
| The `kumo-relational` pull is denied | Log in to `nvcr.io` as in step 4 |
| `no space left on device` while building | The build cache grows with each rebuild; cap it or run `down --prune` ([disk](#disk)) |
| The Auto Ontology frontend build logs Prisma `DatabaseNotReachable` | Expected: it pre-renders pages without a database, and the build succeeds |
| The Kumo NIM logs `TagsBasedProfileSelector not able to find the profile` | Expected on any GPU; it selects its only profile next (step 4) |
| `market-analytics-gpu` takes about 25 s to turn healthy | The worker loads the pack and warms up every tool on the GPU first (step 7) |
| `uv: command not found` in `ssh <instance> 'command'` | Brev's uv is in `~/.local/bin`, on the `PATH` of a login shell only; use `ssh <instance> 'bash -lc "command"'` |
| `test e2e` fails before any test runs | It needs Node.js 22 and sudo for Chromium's libraries (step 9) |
| Every GPU parity test errors while the worker loads the pack | `CUDF_PANDAS_FAIL_ON_FALLBACK` is set, and starting the worker falls back four times; unset it (step 7) |

Do not publish the demo's ports on the VM's public interface or through a public port share; the one
exception is the UI behind a trusted proxy such as a Brev secure link (step 8). The UI has no sign-in and
spends your inference credits, and Switchyard, Phoenix and the Auto Ontology MCP server have no
authentication at all.
