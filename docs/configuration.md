# Configuration

All configuration lives in `.env` at the repository root. `./scripts/demo.sh init` creates it from
[`.env.example`](../.env.example) with mode 600 and fills in the internal secrets; you add one build.nvidia.com
(`nvapi-`) key. `.env` is gitignored and must never be committed. `./scripts/demo.sh replay` needs no `.env` at all.

## How `.env` is read

- `demo.sh` never sources `.env`, because bash and Compose parse it differently. It reads the values from
  `docker compose config --environment`, so both see the same thing.
- A variable set in your shell wins over `.env`, as in Compose:
  `COMPOSE_PROFILES=core ./scripts/demo.sh up`.
- Keep comments on their own lines, never after a value.
- To run Compose by hand, pass the OpenShell pins along with `.env` (passing `--env-file` turns off Compose's
  own `.env` lookup):

  ```bash
  docker compose --env-file infra/openshell/versions.env --env-file .env ps
  ```

  A raw `up` skips what `demo.sh` derives (below) and the sandbox bring-up, so use `demo.sh` for anything that
  starts services.

## Variables

### 1. Inference endpoint

The agent's models (through Switchyard) and Auto Ontology's reasoning models.

| Variable | Default in `.env.example` | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `INFERENCE_BASE_URL` | `https://integrate.api.nvidia.com/v1` | OpenAI-compatible endpoint: build.nvidia.com, or any other OpenAI-compatible endpoint |
| `INFERENCE_API_KEY` | – | Key for that endpoint (`nvapi-` for build.nvidia.com). Read by Switchyard, Auto Ontology and, when `RETRIEVER_API_KEY` is empty, the retrieval tools |
| `SWITCHYARD_ROUTES` | `passthrough.nemotron` | The routing template in `infra/switchyard/routes/` |
| `AGENT_EFFICIENT_MODEL` | `nvidia/nemotron-3-ultra-550b-a55b` | The passthrough model; the model an escalation template tries first |
| `AGENT_CAPABLE_MODEL` | `gpt-6-sol` | The model a session escalates to; the pinned model. Unused by `passthrough.nemotron` |
| `AGENT_JUDGE_MODEL` | `nvidia/nemotron-3-super-120b-a12b` | The escalation judge, and Hermes' auxiliary calls (thinking off) |
| `CAPABLE_BASE_URL`, `CAPABLE_API_KEY` | empty | The capable model's own OpenAI-compatible endpoint and key. Empty means `INFERENCE_BASE_URL` and `INFERENCE_API_KEY` |
| `SWITCHYARD_CONFIRMATIONS` | `1` | Consecutive "escalate" verdicts before a session switches (1 or 2) |
| `AUTO_ONTOLOGY_REASONING_MODEL`, `AUTO_ONTOLOGY_NON_REASONING_MODEL` | `nvidia/nemotron-3-super-120b-a12b`, `nvidia/nemotron-3.5-lightning-30b-a3b` | Auto Ontology's models (ontology profile) |

The model ids a template uses must all differ. Which combination to use, and why the default is Nemotron 3
Ultra alone, is in [models and routing](models-and-routing.md).

**A capable model from another provider.** build.nvidia.com serves no GPT model, so the `*-gpt` templates
(`escalation.nemotron-gpt`, `pinned-capable.nemotron-gpt`) need `CAPABLE_BASE_URL` and `CAPABLE_API_KEY`
pointed at an OpenAI-compatible provider that serves `AGENT_CAPABLE_MODEL` over the Responses API. Only the
capable model goes there; the efficient and judge models stay on `INFERENCE_BASE_URL`. Then:

```bash
./scripts/demo.sh doctor --keys
./scripts/demo.sh restart switchyard   # re-renders the routes; the sandbox is kept
```

**Another OpenAI-compatible endpoint for every model**, for example a gateway serving both Nemotron and GPT-6
models: set `INFERENCE_BASE_URL` and `INFERENCE_API_KEY` to it, leave `CAPABLE_BASE_URL` and `CAPABLE_API_KEY`
empty, and use the model ids that endpoint lists. Set `RETRIEVER_API_KEY` (section 2) to an `nvapi-` key if
that endpoint's key is not one.

`doctor` checks only the models the selected template uses. On build.nvidia.com it rejects a non-`nvapi-`
key, a model id that is not `publisher/model`, and a `*-gpt` template whose capable model would also go to
build.nvidia.com. `doctor --keys` asks each endpoint for its model list and looks for every id. Under the
ontology profile, run `./scripts/demo.sh up` after a change as well: Auto Ontology reads the inference
endpoint, and `up` recreates its services with the new values.

### 2. Retriever endpoint

Document embedding and reranking, for retrieval and Auto Ontology. It is separate from the inference endpoint,
so section 1 can point at an endpoint that has no route for the VL reranker.

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `RETRIEVER_BASE_URL` | `https://integrate.api.nvidia.com/v1` | build.nvidia.com or a self-hosted NIM |
| `RETRIEVER_API_KEY` | empty | Key for that endpoint. Empty means `INFERENCE_API_KEY`, so one `nvapi-` key serves both by default |
| `RETRIEVER_EMBED_MODEL` | `nvidia/nemotron-3-embed-1b` | Embedding model |
| `RETRIEVER_RERANK_MODEL` | `nvidia/llama-nemotron-rerank-vl-1b-v2` | Reranking model |
| `RETRIEVER_RERANK_URL` | empty | Full rerank URL, e.g. a self-hosted NIM's `http://<host>:8000/v1/ranking`. Empty means the model's hosted build.nvidia.com endpoint |

Changing the embed model or the base URL changes the index: run `./scripts/demo.sh data reindex`.
[Retrieval](retrieval.md) explains how the endpoints are used.

### 3. What runs

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `COMPOSE_PROFILES` | `core,retrieval,analytics` | The profiles to run (below). Commands that run the stack always add `core` |
| `UI_PORT` | `3100` | The UI's port on 127.0.0.1 |

### 4. Data pack

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `DATA_PACK` | `synthetic-market` | A directory under `data/packs/`: `synthetic-market` (fictional, made with NeMo Data Designer) or `us-equities` (real prices you fetch) |
| `DATA_PACK_PROFILE` | the pack's default (`standard`) | `synthetic-market`'s scale: `standard` (2,000 issuers, daily bars), `interactive` (50, fast), `ci` (12, minute bars), `intraday` (500, minute bars) or `large` (10,000) |
| `DATA_CORPORA` | the pack's defaults | Comma-separated corpus sources; empty means `sec_filings` (SEC EDGAR) and `market_regulations` (eCFR). `us-equities` adds the opt-in `world_news` (GDELT headlines) when it is named |
| `SEC_USER_AGENT` | – | A name and an email, required by SEC's fair-access policy for the EDGAR filings corpus and for SEC company data (`us-equities`) |
| `DATA_SOURCE_DIR` | `$HOME/market-demo-data` | Where external datasets live on the host, outside the repository: one directory per dataset, mounted read-only at `/sources`. On a VM, the large disk |
| `DATA_SOURCE_<ID>` | – | Where `data fetch` gets external dataset `<id>` (upper case, `-` as `_`; `us-equities` reads `DATA_SOURCE_MINUTE_BARS`): a directory or `host:/path` (rsync), or an `https`, `s3`, `gs` or `hf` URL. Empty: verify what is in place |
| `DATA_SOURCE_HTTP_TOKEN`, `AWS_*`, `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`, `HF_TOKEN` | – | Credentials for those URLs, only when the source needs them. Each reaches only the one-shot fetch run, and only for its scheme |
| `DATA_DUCKDB_MEMORY` | DuckDB's default | A memory cap for the data build, e.g. `8GB`; past it the rollup spills to the data volume |

After changing any of them, run `./scripts/demo.sh data prepare` (and `data fetch` first for a new external
dataset). See [data packs](data-packs.md) and [data platform](data-platform.md).

### 5. Internal secrets

Generated by `init` (64 random hex characters each); `init` on an existing `.env` fills only empty ones.

| Variable | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `HERMES_API_SERVER_KEY` | The API's bearer key for Hermes' Runs API in the sandbox. At least 16 characters, or Hermes' API server does not start |
| `HERMES_RECEIPT_API_KEY` | The key on the plugin's calls to the API's `/internal/hermes` routes. Hermes only sees an OpenShell placeholder. Must differ from the server key |
| `AUTO_ONTOLOGY_ADMIN_PASSWORD`, `AUTO_ONTOLOGY_AUTH_SECRET` | Auto Ontology's local admin password (the API signs in with it) and session secret |

Changing either Hermes key recreates the sandbox on the next `up`.

### 6. Optional

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `KUMO_RELATIONAL_URL` | empty | A hosted Kumo Relational endpoint instead of the kumo profile's local NIM. Setting it gives the agent `predict_asset_outcomes` (needs analytics or analytics-gpu) |
| `KUMO_API_KEY` | empty | Only for a hosted Kumo endpoint (sent as `X-API-Key`) |
| `JOB_RETENTION_SECONDS` | `86400` | How long finished jobs stay available |
| `MARKET_ANALYTICS_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` | `120` | How long one market tool call may run before its worker is replaced |
| `PHOENIX_URL` | `http://127.0.0.1:6006` | The Phoenix address the browser links to; empty hides the link |

### Derived by `demo.sh`

Compose cannot compute these, so `demo.sh` exports them before every Compose call:

| Variable | Value |
|---|---|
| `COMPOSE_PROFILES` | `core,retrieval,analytics` when unset |
| `AGENT_FEATURES` | The tools baked into the agent image, from the profiles: `retrieval`, `analytics` (also for analytics-gpu), `kumo` (the kumo profile or a hosted `KUMO_RELATIONAL_URL`) and `ontology` |
| `KUMO_RELATIONAL_URL` | `http://kumo-relational:8000` under the kumo profile |
| `AUTO_ONTOLOGY_URL` | `http://auto-ontology-frontend:3000` under the ontology profile, for the API's ontology view |
| `DATA_DATABASE_NAME` | The pack id in snake case (`synthetic-market` → `synthetic_market`) |

The services' own settings (queue sizes, Hermes run budgets, timeouts) have working defaults and are
documented in each component's README, for example [`api/README.md`](../api/README.md#environment).

## Profiles

| Profile | Adds | Needs |
|---|---|---|
| `core` (always) | UI, API, OpenShell and the Hermes sandbox, Switchyard, Phoenix, the data build | the inference key |
| `retrieval` | Milvus, the document corpus and index, `retrieve_evidence` | the retriever key; `SEC_USER_AGENT` for `sec_filings` |
| `analytics` | the seven market tools on CPU (pandas, scikit-learn, NetworkX) | – |
| `analytics-gpu` | the same tools on RAPIDS (cuDF, cuML, nx-cugraph), with the same answers; never together with `analytics`. On an A100 at 2,000 issuers, 1.5x to 8.1x faster than the CPU tools on seven of nine measured calls, the two smallest breaking even or running slower ([measured](operations.md#brev-vm-mode)); `intraday_scan` over real minute bars, 4x to 12x ([measured](../tools/market-analytics/README.md#intraday_scan-on-real-minute-bars)) | Linux, an NVIDIA GPU with driver 535 or newer, the NVIDIA Container Toolkit |
| `kumo` | Kumo Relational NIM behind `predict_asset_outcomes`; needs `analytics` or `analytics-gpu` | x86_64 and an NVIDIA GPU (it ran on an A100 with no override); the image from `nvcr.io`, which pulled without a login ([operations](operations.md#brev-vm-mode)) |
| `ontology` | Auto Ontology and `ask_question` | access to the private `NVIDIA/auto-ontology` repository |
| `replay` | the UI alone, on the recorded sessions | nothing |

After changing `COMPOSE_PROFILES`, run `./scripts/demo.sh up`: it rebuilds the agent image with the matching
tools and skills, and recreates the sandbox because the image changed.

## Hardware tiers

| Tier | Profiles | Host |
|---|---|---|
| Replay | `replay` (`./scripts/demo.sh replay`) | Any Docker host; no keys, no GPU |
| CPU | `core,retrieval,analytics` (the default), optionally with a hosted `KUMO_RELATIONAL_URL` | Linux kernel 6.2 or later on the Docker host (OpenShell needs Landlock ABI 3), Docker Engine 28+, Compose 2.30+, at least 8 GiB of memory for Docker (Milvus), x86_64 or arm64. Verified on macOS with colima (arm64, 4 CPU, 9 GiB) |
| GPU | `core,retrieval,analytics-gpu,kumo` | Linux x86_64 with an NVIDIA GPU, driver 535 or newer and the NVIDIA Container Toolkit. The Kumo NIM image is about 14 GB to download and 44 GB on disk, and runs with a 16 GB shared-memory segment. Plan for 150 GB of free disk, or 200 GB to rebuild images on the host ([disk](operations.md#disk)). On a 40 GB A100 the stack held 4.3 GiB of GPU memory once Kumo had predicted, and 9.3 GiB of RAM ([footprint](operations.md#brev-vm-mode)). Target: a Brev A100 VM ([operations](operations.md#brev-vm-mode)) |

Models always run on the hosted endpoints; no tier serves a model locally. On macOS, Docker Desktop needs host
networking on and Enhanced Container Isolation off (an OpenShell requirement, not verified here); colima
needs neither.

## `doctor`

`./scripts/demo.sh doctor` checks the host (Docker, Compose and kernel versions, the NVIDIA runtime and
architecture for the GPU profiles, Docker memory for Milvus), that the published ports are free (skipped
while the stack runs), and that
`.env` is consistent: profile rules, required keys, distinct model ids for the template, an existing template,
key and model id shapes on build.nvidia.com, `SEC_USER_AGENT` for `sec_filings`, and the generated secrets. `up` runs the same checks
except ports and keys. Messages name variables, never their values.

`doctor --keys` also asks each endpoint for its model list with your key and looks for every id the selected
template uses. It checks listing, not access: some gateways list models outside a key's access group, and
those still return 403 when called. The hosted rerankers are not listed at all; the first index build checks the reranker.

## State and exit codes

- `.demo/` holds `demo.sh`'s lifecycle state (the OpenShell volume records described in
  [OpenShell](openshell.md#known-issues-in-openshell-012)). It ignores itself.
- `.build/` holds the patched Auto Ontology source that `tools/auto-ontology/prepare.sh` writes.

| Exit code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 0 | Success |
| 1 | A check failed (`check`, a question `record` could not answer) |
| 2 | Usage error |
| 64 | `.env` or profile problem (`doctor`) |
| 69 | A host requirement or a service is missing (Docker unreachable, gateway or sandbox not ready) |
