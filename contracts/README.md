# Contracts

The JSON that services share. Services never import each other's code; they agree on these files.

| Path | Source | Used by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `tool-registry.json` | Hand-written | api, agent plugin, UI (as `TOOL_REGISTRY`), wiring tests |
| `tool-registry.schema.json` | Hand-written | Validates the registry |
| `schemas/execution-event.schema.json` | Generated from `api/src/demo_api/events/` | UI types, replay bundles |
| `schemas/receipt.schema.json` | Generated from `api/src/demo_api/receipts/` | UI types, agent plugin tests |
| `fixtures/*.json` | Hand-curated, canonicalized by the generator | api and UI tests |

TypeScript for all three schemas is generated into `ui/src/generated/`.

## Regenerate

```bash
scripts/gen-contracts.sh           # after changing a model, the registry or a fixture
scripts/gen-contracts.sh --check   # CI: fails if anything is out of date
```

The script exports the Pydantic models as JSON Schema, validates every fixture and rewrites it
in canonical form, then runs `json-schema-to-typescript` and Prettier (both pinned). Commit
what it writes. Never edit `schemas/` or `ui/src/generated/` by hand.

## Tool registry

One entry per MCP tool. Adding a tool starts here.

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `id` | MCP tool name, e.g. `retrieve_evidence` |
| `server` | Hermes MCP server key: `retrieval`, `market_analytics`, `auto_ontology` |
| `hermes_name` | `mcp__<server>__<id>`, the name Hermes and the receipts use |
| `family` | Capability a data source must grant: `unstructured_retrieval`, `market_analytics`, `structured_retrieval`, `structured_prediction` |
| `label`, `description` | Display text for the UI |
| `explorer` | UI explorer: `retrieval`, `market`, `sql`, `pql`, `ontology` |
| `receipt_kind` | The `artifactKind` of the tool's receipts |
| `profile` | Compose profile that provides the tool |

## Execution events (`execution.v2`)

The API emits every execution observation as one `ExecutionEventV2`. The event store gives each
row a monotonic per-job cursor. `GET /v1/jobs/async/job/{job_id}/stream` sends each event as an
SSE frame with `event: execution.v2`, `id: <cursor>` and the event (without `cursor`) as data.
Clients resume with `/v1/jobs/async/job/{job_id}/stream/{cursor}` or `Last-Event-ID`.

The `tool.*` and `artifact.*` events of a registered tool carry the tool's registry `family` as
`capabilityId`, and the family decides `componentId` (`COMPONENT_BY_FAMILY` in
`api/src/demo_api/events/execution.py`):

| `family` | `componentId` |
| --- | --- |
| `unstructured_retrieval` | `milvus.retrieval` |
| `market_analytics` | `nvidia.market_analytics` |
| `structured_retrieval` | `nvidia.ontology` |
| `structured_prediction` | `nvidia.kumo` |

`display.attributes` is open JSON with snake_case keys. Model calls are `llm.call` events whose
attributes carry `served_model` (the model Switchyard served) and `tier` (`efficient` or
`capable`), so the UI can show when a run escalates. Token counts are `input_tokens` and
`output_tokens`; `prompt_tokens` and `completion_tokens` are rejected (see
[the limits](#display-safe-json-limits)).

## Receipts (`ReceiptV2`)

The agent plugin posts one receipt per registered tool call to
`POST /internal/hermes/jobs/{job_id}/tool-receipts`. `receiptId` is the evidence id the agent
cites; events reference it in `artifactRefs`. The union is discriminated by `artifactKind`,
one variant per `receipt_kind` in the registry. Content mirrors the tool's own result:

| `artifactKind` | Tools | Content |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `retrieval_evidence` | `retrieve_evidence` | The tool's `RetrievalResult` |
| `analytics_result` | the seven market tools | The tool's `MarketResult`, plus `public_parameters` |
| `structured_query` | `ask_question` | Question, SQL, rows, ontology lineage |
| `structured_prediction` | `predict_asset_outcomes` | The tool's `PredictionResult` |

The API accepts field names in snake_case or camelCase and serves camelCase. Keys inside open
JSON (`payload`, `publicParameters`, `rows`, `metadata`) are kept as sent.

A completed receipt always has content. A failed one may carry `errorType`, `errorSummary` and
any bounded content the tool returned.

### From tool result to receipt

The plugin never makes up a value. When a tool does not report a fact, the receipt does not
carry it.

| Receipt field | Source |
| --- | --- |
| `toolName` | The registry `hermes_name` |
| `durationMs` | Hermes' `post_tool_call` `duration_ms`: the tool's own execution time |
| `occurredAt` | The plugin's clock at `post_tool_call` |
| `status` | `failed` when the call raised or the result reports a failure (analytics `status: failed`, prediction `available: false`); otherwise `completed` |
| `errorType` | The analytics `error.code`, `evidence_unavailable` for an unavailable prediction, or the Hermes error category when the call raised |
| `errorSummary` | The analytics `error.message`, the prediction `reason`, or the Hermes error |
| `content` | The tool's result, fitted to the limits below |

Per tool, `content` is:

- `retrieve_evidence`: the result as returned. A `published_at` that is not a timestamp with a
  timezone becomes null.
- The market tools: the result as returned, plus `public_parameters`, the call's arguments
  without `source_ids`.
- `predict_asset_outcomes`: the result as returned.
- `ask_question`: the question, the target database, Auto Ontology's answer and SQL, up to 25
  rows (`truncated` and `source_row_count` record any cut) and the resolution lineage.

Compared with the prototype's receipts, retrieval, analytics and prediction content now uses the
current tools' field names. The synthetic `receipt_tool_name`, the locator and content digest
(both derivable from `receiptId`), the derived counts and statuses, and the GPU-index, benchmark,
cache and scope-grant fields are gone.

## Display-safe JSON limits

The API runs every receipt `content` and every event's `display.attributes` through
`validate_bounded_display_json` in `api/src/demo_api/events/models.py`. JSON Schema cannot
express these rules, so `receipt.schema.json` does not show them. One violation rejects the whole
receipt or event.

| Rule | Limit |
| --- | --- |
| `MAX_JSON_DEPTH` | Values sit at most 6 levels below `content` or `attributes` |
| `MAX_JSON_ITEMS` | 100 items per array, 100 fields per object |
| `MAX_JSON_NODES` | 2,000 nodes in total, counting objects, arrays and values |
| `MAX_JSON_TEXT_CHARS` | 32,000 characters per string |
| Keys | 1 to 128 characters |
| Numbers | Finite |
| Text | No control characters except tab, line feed and carriage return |

An object key is rejected, at any depth, when this case-insensitive pattern matches anywhere in it:

```text
thought|reasoning|prompt|embedding|password|passwd|secret|token|credential|api[_-]?key|
authorization|cookie|connection(?:_string)?|private[_-]?key|access[_-]?key|
filesystem|file[_-]?path|storage[_-]?uri|dsn
```

So `system_prompt`, `token_count` and `prompt_tokens` are all rejected. The exceptions are the
usage keys `input_tokens`, `output_tokens`, `total_tokens`, `reasoning_tokens`,
`cached_input_tokens`, `cache_write_tokens`, `max_output_tokens` and `token_usage`, and
`query_embedding_ms` when it is a finite, non-negative number.

The plugin fits each result before it posts it, as the prototype's projection did:

1. Drop every key that matches the pattern, such as a SQL column named `token_count`.
2. Cut each list to the schema's `maxItems`, or to 100 where the schema has none. SQL rows keep
   at most 40 columns, so 25 rows fit in the 2,000-node budget.
3. Record every cut. A payload list with a sibling flag (`series_truncated`, `points_truncated`,
   `events_truncated`) sets it to true; SQL rows set `truncated` and keep `source_row_count`.
4. Cut each string to the schema's `maxLength`, for example a hit's `snippet` to 1,500 characters.
5. Replace each control character the Text rule refuses with a space.

## Fixtures

`fixtures/execution-events.json` is one sanitized run from the prototype's recordings (a market
anomaly scan and a document retrieval) with two illustrative `llm.call` events added.
`fixtures/receipts.json` holds that run's two receipts plus an Auto Ontology SQL receipt and a
Kumo prediction receipt from other recorded runs. The recorded values were reshaped into the
current tools' results: the index settings are the current retrieval tool's, and the analytics
compute time and the collection fingerprint are illustrative. The failed prediction follows the
tool's path for an unreachable Kumo NIM. There is one completed receipt per `artifactKind` and one
failed prediction.
