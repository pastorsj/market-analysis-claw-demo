/**
 * Execution Feature Slot
 *
 * The execution view (graph, capability explorers, timeline, replay) lives in
 * `features/execution` and plugs into the base UI through this one typed
 * interface. The base UI works without it: `noExecutionFeature` renders
 * nothing and ignores job events.
 *
 * The implementation is wired once, in `app/providers.tsx`.
