 * A stand-in for the demo API, just enough for the live-mode smoke test:

 * any WAV recording.
 *
 * A job is known once its submission is admitted: before that its status and
 * stream are 404, as the API's are. By default it is admitted at once and its
 * stream answers immediately. A test can plan a job before submitting it
 * (`POST /e2e/jobs/<id>` with `{admitAfterMs, runForMs}`): its admission then
 * waits, so the submission is still in flight, and it runs for a while, its
 * stream sending heartbeats until it answers.
