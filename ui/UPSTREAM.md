# Upstream

This UI is derived from the AI-Q blueprint UI (Apache-2.0, see [LICENSE](LICENSE)):

- Repository: https://github.com/NVIDIA-AI-Blueprints/aiq, path `frontends/ui`
- Base: `develop` at `bf4e67d1564ef8d2ec8f65b5f9001e512befc095` (2026-08-28)

Files keep their upstream SPDX headers; new files carry a 2026 header. To take an
upstream fix, diff the base against a newer upstream commit and cherry-pick the
hunks that touch files still present here:

```bash
git -C <aiq clone> diff bf4e67d1 <new> -- frontends/ui
```

## What changed and why

The demo has one agent (Hermes, in an OpenShell sandbox) behind a plain FastAPI
API, no app authentication and no uploads. Every question is a durable job on
`/v1/jobs/async`, and its answer is the job's `final_report`. Upstream's NAT
chat, its deep-research panel and everything only they used are removed.

The chat store keeps 27 of its 77 actions. 50 were removed: 12 that upstream
never calls outside the store (of its 14 such actions, `restoreSessionState`
and `persistDeepResearchToSession` are kept), and 38 that only the removed
chat, panel, HITL and upload code used. Three were added: `finishDeepResearch`,
`cancelActiveDeepResearchJob` and `openRecordedSession`.

### Modified

- `features/chat`: `use-deep-research` follows one job's stream and settles the
  answer in the chat (answer-first, as in the prototype); `store` and `types`
  drop the NAT state; the banners and error registry keep only the cases that
  still occur. `DeepResearchBanner` copy follows the prototype ("Run started",
  "Run failed", "Run stopped", "Run unavailable"). The saved sessions' job
  statuses refresh from `app/providers.tsx` in live mode only, not on store
  rehydration, so replay mode never calls the API.
- `features/layout`: `MainLayout` hosts the execution slots and replay mode;
  `ResearchPanel` becomes the "Agent Activity" host, resizable as in the
  prototype (`activity-panel-resize.ts`), following the running job or else the
  conversation's last answer; `ChatArea` adds "View Execution"; `InputArea`
  submits jobs and stops them, and gains the prototype's microphone when
  `SPEECH_INPUT_ENABLED` is set; `DataSourcesPanel` loses
  its Files tab; `AppBar` loses sign-in and gains the Phoenix link;
  `SessionsPanel` gains a read-only mode for recordings.
- `adapters/api`: the job client and data sources client call the same-origin
  `/api/v1` proxy; `pack-client` is new.
- `shared/components/Sources`: references of the form ``Label — evidence `id` —
invocation `id` `` become inspectable evidence (`EvidenceDisclosure`).
- `app`: `layout.tsx` title "Enterprise Research"; `page.tsx` is the landing
  page; the chat moved to `research/page.tsx`.
- Visible copy: the sign-in states and the "AI-Q" label next to the logo are
  gone (as in the prototype); the "Answer complete" banner is gone, since a
  successful job shows its answer instead (answer-first); the no-sources banner
  no longer mentions files;
  the landing page names LangChain instead of LlamaIndex and adds OpenShell and
  Switchyard to the Hermes card.
- Landing page: it keeps the prototype's technology logos
  (`public/ecosystem-logos`) and adds the LangChain symbol; Kumo, which has no
  logo file, gets a text badge of the same size. The Market Analytics card
  lists RAPIDS cuDF, cuGraph and cuML. The featured questions sit in a 3 × 2 grid of
  short cards (the full question is in the link and its tooltip), and the
  observability flow shares the footer row, so the page fits 1280×800,
  1440×900 and 1920×1080 without scrolling.

### Dependencies

- Added: `uuid` (was imported but undeclared) and `@playwright/test`.
- Removed: `next-auth`, `@react-pdf/renderer`, `marked`, `http-proxy`,
  `concurrently`, `husky`, `msw`, `@mswjs/data`, `@faker-js/faker`,
  `@types/uuid`, `autoprefixer`.
- Updated: `next` and `eslint-config-next` 16.2.12 → 16.3.7 (image-optimizer
  and `sharp` advisories), `vitest` and `@vitest/coverage-v8` 4.1.0 → 4.1.11
  (mocker advisory). `npm audit` reports 0 vulnerabilities.
- Kept on the upstream pin: `@nvidia/foundations-react-core` 0.600, React 18.
